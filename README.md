Email data leaks present serious risks to companies, leading to financial loss, reputation harm, and legal issues. Traditional methods like NDAs and basic encryption are inadequate in tracing the source of leaks. There is an urgent need for advanced solutions that can detect and prevent leaks proactively. The proposed AI-driven solution uses multivariate testing and large language models (LLMs) to create unique document versions for each employee, allowing for precise identification of leak sources. This technology allows to detect the source of the leak, thereby giving confidence to stakeholders of the repercussions of a leak, and is designed to start with documents and emails before expanding to other sensitive data.
